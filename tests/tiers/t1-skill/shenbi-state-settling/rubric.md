|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Instruction adherence | 10% | Every SKILL.md section executed |
| 2 | Output completeness | 5% | All required output sections produced |

## Bespoke Dimensions (85%)

| # | Dimension | Weight | Standard |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 3 | Extraction accuracy | 20% | Only explicit chapter changes recorded; no inference |
| 4 | Category completeness | 15% | All 9 change categories evaluated |
| 5 | Certainty distinction | 15% | Direct vs. implied changes tagged differently |
| 6 | Incremental correctness | 15% | Appends without rewriting truth files |
| 7 | Human gate | 10% | No truth file updated before human approval |
| 8 | Cross-reference consistency | 10% | Changes to one truth file reflected in related files |

## Kill Switches by Test Type

### Bug-Hunt Kill Switches
- Missed planted defect (false negative) -> total score = 0
- HARD-GATE violation -> total score = 0

### Clean Kill Switches
- Any hallucinated defect (false positive) -> total score = 0
- HARD-GATE violation -> total score = 0

### Generative Kill Switches
- HARD-GATE violation -> total score = 0

## Dimension Applicability by Test Type

| Dimension scope | Bug-hunt | Clean | Generative |
|----------------|----------|-------|------------|
| Universal (1-2) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| All bespoke | Yes (detection quality) | Yes (report quality) | Yes (output quality) |

## Scoring Rules
- Each dimension scored 0-100
- Final = weighted sum of all dimensions
- Kill switch triggered -> final = 0 (overrides all scores)
- 90-100: PASS | 75-89: PASS (acceptable) | 60-74: CONDITIONAL | 0-59: FAIL
